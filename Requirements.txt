Hacker roadmap
This repository is an overview of what you need to learn penetration testing and a collection of hacking tools, resources and references to practice ethical hacking. Most of the tools are UNIX compatible, free and open source.

Before you start
If you're new to information security, forget everything you know about hacking.
Don't start using tools without reading about pen testing and how it works (see Additional resources section).
Don't download or use tools if you haven't audited its code.
Don't use these tools to do stupid things like investigating/hacking without consent on your friends, or worst, your recruiter.
Read books, manuals, articles, be curious and not just a script kiddie.
I wish you don't use these tools for illegal purposes, but if you do, I sure hope you know what you're doing.
Practice using challenges, not real targets!
